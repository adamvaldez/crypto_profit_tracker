### About
I wrote the following script to help me keep track of my crypto's progress.
If you are using a Ledger or any other hardware wallet, keeping track of your gains.
1. Displays ist all of your cryptos names, current price, percentage change and your value in USD.
2. Displays Hardware crypto individual USD value, total value of hardware
3. Displays total USD value, USD invested, USD profit, profit % in color

### Setup
1. Install coinmarketcap via pip or prefered method
> pip install coinmarketcap
2. Install termcolor via pip or prefered method
> pip install termcolor
3. Enter your crypto values from your ledger in the *ledger* dictionary
4. Enter your crypto values from your exchange in the *exchange* dictionary
5. Enter your investment amount (how much USD have you invested in total)
6. Depending on where all the crypto you own ranks, adjust the *limit* and loop variable (keep the equal)
7. Add your crypto names from the exchange into the if
8. Add your crypto names from the exchange into the elif

1. Inside the proper directory run **'python crypto_profit_tracker.py'**
